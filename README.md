## Installation
To set up your environment and run the app, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Ensure you have a Firebase project set up as this app uses Firebase for authentication and database (for the study). Visit [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) to create a new project if you haven't done so.
- After setting up your Firebase project, you will need to configure the environment variables for the app. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project and include your Firebase project's configuration details and any other API URLs or keys your app might use. The `.env` file should look something like this:

```bash
API_KEY=your_firebase_api_key_here
AUTH_DOMAIN=your_firebase_auth_domain_here
PROJECT_ID=your_firebase_project_id_here
STORAGE_BUCKET=your_firebase_storage_bucket_here
MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_firebase_messaging_sender_id_here
APP_ID=your_firebase_app_id_here
```

### Step 1: Install node modules

Before you can run the app, you need to install its dependencies. Open your terminal, navigate to your project's root directory, and run:

```bash
npm install
```

### Step 2: Launch the app
Execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npx expo start
```
This starts the Expo CLI server. You'll see a QR code displayed in your terminal. Scan this QR code with the Expo Go app (available on Android and iOS) to run your app on your mobile device. Alternatively, you can:

* Press i to open the app in the iOS simulator (macOS only).
* Press a to open the app in the Android emulator (ensure you have an emulator installed beforehand).
