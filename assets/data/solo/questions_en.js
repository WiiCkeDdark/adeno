It is a sovereign competence that usually belongs to the Member States, but which they sometimes delegate to the EU because it has a greater economic and demographic weight. On the administrative level, the EU has its own diplomatic service, the European External Action Service. Politically, decisions are made by the Council of the EU, where the Member States are represented. For a decision related to the CFSP to be adopted in the Council, the unanimous votes of those present are required, which means that a single country can block the other 26.

      "The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) is a defense and military cooperation alliance of 31 countries, including the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and most EU countries (excluding Austria & Ireland). It was created to prevent aggression from the Soviet Union against European countries. Article 5 of the treaty states that any aggression against one member of the alliance will be considered an aggression against all alliance members, serving as a deterrent to any frontal attack, as NATO represents 55% of global military spending and has over 3 million soldiers in service. With the war in Ukraine, Finland joined NATO in 2023, and Sweden is expected to do the same in 2024. However, membership in the military organization is theoretically contingent on an annual expenditure of 2% of a member state's GDP on NATO activities, a criterion that most members do not meet.",

      "The European Directive on Minimum Wages of 2022 aims to establish a fair minimum wage in the EU, ensuring decent living conditions for workers. The amount of monthly minimum wages in EU member countries varies greatly: it is €332 per month in Bulgaria and €2,256 in Luxembourg (Eurostat 2022). To reduce these disparities, the EU aims to harmonize minimum wages. Each country must set a minimum monthly wage suitable for its socio-economic condition. The EU thus wants to promote social cohesion, reduce poverty, and protect workers, especially women.",
