Date of signature: April 18, 1951.
  
Date of entry into force: July 23, 1952
  
Date of expiration: July 23, 2002 (competences taken over by the EU)
  
Signing countries: Germany; Belgium; France; Luxembourg; Italy; Netherlands.
  
Place of signature: Paris.
  
Effects: Establishment of a common market for coal and steel, abolition of customs duties, establishment of anti-discriminatory rules, and prohibition of national subsidies.
  
The Treaty of Paris designates the result of negotiations leading to the signing of the Treaty establishing the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) in Paris on April 18, 1951, coming into force on July 15, 1952. This treaty established a common market for coal and steel, thereby abolishing customs duties and favoring the free movement of products, with anti-discriminatory rules and the prohibition of national subsidies.
  
The implementation of the single market was progressive, including a preparatory period and a transition period for the adaptation of national industries. The High Authority, chaired by Jean Monnet, exercised supranational power with enforceable decisions and subject to judicial appeals. This collegiate authority, composed of 9 members, worked to modernize production, ensure fair supply, promote joint export, and improve working conditions.
  
The financing of the ECSC was independent of the states and was based on "own resources" levied directly on coal and steel companies. The Common Assembly, composed of 78 deputies, controlled the acts of the High Authority without legislative or budgetary power. A special Council of Ministers shared decision-making power with the High Authority, and a Court of Justice settled disputes.
  
The achievements of the ECSC stimulated trade, modernized production, doubled steel production, and stabilized the supply of iron and scrap. Although the ECSC faced a coal crisis in the 1950s, it laid the foundations for supranational cooperation by expanding the community framework with the creation of the European Economic Community and Euratom in 1957.`,

Date of signature: March 25, 1957
  
Date of entry into force: January 1, 1958
  
Signing countries: Germany; Belgium; France; Italy; Luxembourg; Netherlands.
  
Place of signature: Rome.
  
Effects: Creation of the European Economic Community (EEC). Creation of the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom or EEC).
  
On March 25, 1957, Germany, Belgium, France, Italy, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands signed in Rome two treaties that entered into force on January 14, 1958: the first established the European Economic Community (EEC), and the second the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom or EEC). The EEC aimed to establish a common market, harmonize economic policies, promote balanced development, ensure increased stability, raise living standards, and strengthen ties between member states. Inspired by the 1951 ECSC treaty, the EEC expanded supranational cooperation into the economic domain, adopting initiatives created by the Benelux Union.
  
The Euratom Community aimed to contribute to the formation of a European nuclear industry. The common market involved a customs union, the elimination of customs duties, a common trade policy, and a common customs tariff towards third countries, with a 12-year transition period. The principle of free competition was established, prohibiting agreements between companies and state aids, except for those of a social nature. The single market also provided for the free movement of people, services, and capital.
  
The Treaty of Rome created an institutional system with the European Commission, the Council of Ministers (now known as the Council of the EU), the European Parliament, the Court of Justice, and the Economic and Social Committee. The institutions of the EEC and the Euratom Community were perceived as less supranational than those of the ECSC, establishing decision-making mechanisms that expressed national interests and a community vision. The 12-year transition period of the common market showed spectacular results, multiplying intra-community trade by 6 and trade with third countries by 3. The Treaties of Maastricht (1992) and Lisbon (2009) adapted the European Union to new political areas and expansions.`,

    text: `Name: Treaty of Brussels. Also known as the "Merger Treaty".
  
Date of signature: April 8, 1965.
  
Date of entry into force: July 1, 1967
  
Date of abrogation: October 2, 1997 (by the Treaty of Amsterdam)
  
Signing countries: Germany; Belgium; France; Italy; Luxembourg; Netherlands.
  
Place of signature: Brussels, Belgium.
  
Effects: The Merger Treaty consolidated the institutions and procedures to facilitate the functioning of the European Communities.
  
The Treaty of Brussels, also known as the "Merger Treaty", was signed with the primary objective of unifying the three existing European Communities: the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC), the European Economic Community (EEC), and the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom). This treaty, signed on April 8, 1965, and entered into force on July 1, 1967, aimed to streamline institutions by merging their independent executive bodies while preserving their legally distinct character.
  
Key points of the treaty included the creation of a single Council and a single Commission. The Council of the European Communities, now known as the Council of the European Union, became the single body replacing the specialized councils of the three previous Communities. Similarly, the Commission of the European Communities, now the European Commission, was consolidated to replace the former commissions of each Community.
  
Despite this merger, the single executive bodies continued to act in accordance with the treaties governing each of the three Communities, with some harmonizations and alignments, particularly regarding composition, decision-making rules, political accountability, and budgets.
  
The Treaty of Brussels also introduced a single administrative budget for the European Communities, covering the expenses of all institutions, while maintaining separate budgets for certain specific activities. Moreover, a single administration was established for all Communities, with uniform rules governing officials and agents of the institutions as well as their privileges and immunities.
  
Finally, the treaty also addressed the issue of the seats of the community institutions, giving the governments of the member states the power to jointly decide on the location of the executive bodies, with Brussels designated as the provisional seat.`,

    name: "Single European Act",
    text: `Name: Single European Act
  
Date of signature: February 17 & 28, 1986
  
Date of entry into force: July 1, 1987
  
Signing countries: Initially Belgium; Spain; France; Luxembourg; Netherlands; Portugal; Federal Republic of Germany; United Kingdom and Ireland. Subsequently Denmark; Italy and Greece.
  
Place of signature: Luxembourg and The Hague (Netherlands).
  
Effects: Treaty amendment amending the Treaty of Rome (1957).
  
On February 17, 1986, nine member states signed the Single European Act (SEA), followed by Denmark, Italy, and Greece on February 28, 1986, after a positive referendum. Ratified by the member states in 1986, this treaty entered into force on July 1, 1987.
  
The SEA set the European Economic Community (EEC) the goal of completing the internal market, renamed the single market, before January 1, 1993. For this purpose, it modified the decision-making process by establishing qualified majority voting in the Council and strengthening the powers of the European Parliament in economic and social cohesion, monetary policy. Additionally, it expanded the Community's competences to new areas such as research, the environment, and foreign policy.
  
This treaty amendment amended the Treaty of Rome. It aimed to make effective the freedoms of movement granted in law by the Treaty of Rome, particularly by eliminating obstacles to the common market. The SEA envisaged the completion of the single market before January 1, 1993, creating a space without internal borders for the free movement of goods, people, services, and capital.
  
The SEA also introduced political cooperation among member states to develop a common foreign policy, coordinated by the state holding the presidency of the Council of the EU. This cooperation aimed to ensure the coherence of foreign policy and to represent all member states on the international stage.`,

    text: `Name: Schengen Agreements.
  
Date of signature: June 14, 1985
  
Date of entry into force: March 26, 1995
  
Signing countries: Germany; Belgium; France; Luxembourg; Netherlands. Over the years, other EU countries have joined this agreement, and it is now extended to a number of non-EU countries as well (Switzerland, Norway, Liechtenstein, Iceland)
  
Place of signature: Schengen, Luxembourg.
  
Effects: Laid the foundations for the free movement of people across the internal borders of these countries, as well as police and judicial cooperation.
  
The construction of the Schengen area began in 1985 when five EEC countries decided to create a territory without internal borders. The Schengen agreements, signed in 1985 and 1990, ensured the free movement of people and, with few exceptions, eliminated checks on travelers between these states. Incorporated into the Treaty of Amsterdam in 1997, these agreements are now an integral part of EU law.
  
The majority of EU member states have joined this area, as well as four associated states: Iceland, Norway, Switzerland, and Liechtenstein. In 2007, nine new EU member countries joined the Schengen area, followed by Croatia's accession on January 1, 2023. However, Cyprus and Ireland remain outside this area.
  
Pro tip: The Adeno app was launched on March 1, 2024, marking Romania and Bulgaria's entry into the Schengen area. Welcome!
  
Since the incorporation of the Schengen Acquis into EU law in 1997, Schengen cooperation has become an integral part of the EU's legal and institutional framework.
  
Schengen member states have the option to temporarily reinstate border controls in case of threats to public order or security, for renewable periods of 30 days, up to 24 months in case of serious failure. This ability has been used several times to temporarily reintroduce passport checks, including during sporting events, migration crises, and the Covid-19 pandemic between 2020 and 2022. The Schengen area, often associated with the abolition of internal border controls, also relies on strengthening external borders, a strategy consolidated by the European Commission in June 2021. In September 2020, the European Pact on Migration and Asylum was presented to reform the EU's migration policy, including modifying the Dublin system and encouraging solidarity among member states in welcoming migrants.`,

Date of signature: February 7, 1992
      
Date of entry into force: November 1, 1993
      
Signatory countries: Germany; Belgium; Denmark; Spain; France; Greece; Ireland; Italy; Luxembourg; Netherlands; Portugal; United Kingdom.
      
Place of signature: Maastricht, Netherlands.
      
Effects: This treaty laid the foundations of the European Union as we know it today, in particular by establishing the European single currency, the Euro, and defining the convergence criteria for the adoption of this currency.
      
The Treaty of Maastricht, which came into force on November 1, 1993, establishes the European Union among the 12 member states of the Community (Germany, Belgium, Denmark, Spain, France, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Portugal, and the United Kingdom). It consolidates three areas of action, or "pillars", under the official name of the European Union: the European Community with extended supranational competences, cooperation in foreign policy and security (CFSP), and cooperation in justice and home affairs (JHA).
      
The treaty grants European citizenship to any person holding nationality in a member state, offering rights such as freedom of movement, diplomatic protection abroad, the right to vote in European and municipal elections, the right to petition before the European Parliament, and the possibility to file complaints with the European Ombudsman.
      
Moreover, the treaty decides on the creation of an Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) with a single currency, the euro, which entered into circulation on January 1, 1999. The EMU is realized in three stages, liberalizing capital movements, coordinating economic policies, and establishing a European Central Bank.
      
Community competencies are expanded with the inclusion of new areas such as education, public health, consumer protection, and industrial policy, under the principle of subsidiarity. The social protocol annexed to the treaty strengthens social policy. Additionally, the treaty creates a Committee of the Regions representing local communities.
      
The second pillar of the treaty establishes a Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) with joint actions in foreign policy, while the third pillar facilitates free movement of people with decisions made unanimously, covering areas such as border crossing, the fight against terrorism and crime, judicial cooperation, the creation of Europol, and a common asylum policy.`,

Date of signature: December 13, 2007.

Date of entry into force: December 1, 2009

Signatory countries: Germany; Austria; Belgium; Bulgaria; Cyprus; Croatia; Denmark; Spain; Estonia; Finland; France; Greece; Hungary; Ireland; Italy; Latvia; Lithuania; Luxembourg; Malta; Netherlands; Poland; Portugal; Czech Republic; Romania; Slovakia; Slovenia; Sweden.

Place of signature: Lisbon, Portugal.

Effects: Introduces the legal personality of the EU, enabling international agreements and accession to the European Convention on Human Rights. Simplifies the decision-making process at the Council. Establishes a permanent presidency at the European Council. Creates a High Representative for Foreign Affairs.

The Treaty of Lisbon originates from the Laeken Declaration of 2001, where heads of state or government committed to reforming European institutions to make the Union more democratic and effective. Adopted in 2004, two years after the Treaty of Nice, the project for a constitutional treaty failed in 2005, leading to a period of reflection. Facing deadlock, a solution emerged two years later: a simplified treaty.

At the European Council in June 2007, an Intergovernmental Conference (IGC) was convened to draft a treaty amendment. Approved in October 2007, it was signed in Lisbon in December 2007. The States ratified it successively, with France being the fifth in February 2008. In October 2009, Ireland ratified it after a second referendum, followed by the Czech Republic on November 3, 2009.

Entering into force on December 1, 2009, the Treaty of Lisbon brings major institutional changes. It introduces the legal personality of the EU, enabling international agreements and accession to the European Convention on Human Rights. It simplifies the decision-making process at the Council of the EU, establishes a permanent presidency at the European Council, and creates a High Representative for Foreign Affairs. National parliaments gain an enhanced role, monitoring subsidiarity. The division of competences is clarified, the Charter of Fundamental Rights gains binding legal force, and the European Central Bank becomes a full institution. Judicial and police cooperation is decided predominantly, and the fight against climate change is integrated. Finally, the treaty introduces the exit clause (Article 50), used by the United Kingdom in 2017. Negotiations stretched into 2009, with significant compromises at the Councils of December 2008 and October 2009. In 2012, the TFEU was amended to respond to the public debt crisis in the eurozone, repealing the "no bail out" clause and allowing the creation of the European Stability Mechanism.`,
