    text: `The integration of fundamental rights within the framework of the European Union has emerged gradually, initially absent from the treaties which were primarily oriented towards economic concerns. The Court of Justice of the European Community (CJEC) played a pioneering role in the 1970s by developing unwritten principles, the general principles of community law (GPCL). After 1992, this concern was reinforced with a new formulation of Article 6 of the TEU and the development in 2000 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.
      
Today, human rights apply both to institutions and to states when they act within the scope of EU law. The GPCL, established by jurisprudence, combine principles from international law, common principles of the member states, and principles specific to the EU. The Court of Justice relies on these sources of inspiration to fill the gaps in the treaties and create law, sometimes acting as a legislator.
      
The protection of fundamental rights evolved with the STAUDER ruling in 1969, guaranteeing the right to privacy, and the progressive recognition of fundamental rights as GPCL. The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU, which came into force with the Lisbon Treaty, now provides a legally binding reference for the protection of fundamental rights, covering first-generation rights (inspired by the European Court of Human Rights) as well as second, third, and fourth-generation social rights. It has thus partially replaced the GPCL, marking a significant evolution in the protection of fundamental rights within the European Union.`,

    name: "Freedom",
    text: `Freedom is one of the fundamental values of the European Union, enshrined by the Lisbon Treaty in 2007 and gathered in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU. Article 6 of this Charter guarantees the right to freedom and security for everyone.
      
Freedom in the EU is also manifested through the 4 freedoms of the market, legally guaranteed since 1986. These freedoms allow the free movement of goods, services, capital, and people within the EU. They are considered one of the greatest European successes, alongside peace on the continent. The 4 freedoms are the pillars of the single European market, strengthening trade within the EU. About two-thirds of goods produced in the EU are exported to another EU country, generating positive effects on economic well-being.
      
Moreover, the 4 freedoms help to mitigate economic imbalances between the Eurozone member states. They allow for economic fluctuations to be mitigated, as goods and capital can move according to demand. These adjustments also apply to job seekers and services, subject to linguistic and regulatory barriers.
      
The use of the euro facilitates the integration of the single market by eliminating exchange risk and allowing easier price comparison. The 4 freedoms distinguish the EU from other free trade areas, although it is technically possible to implement only some of them. For example, the free trade agreement between the EU and Canada, CETA, eliminates tariffs but does not guarantee the free movement of people.`,

    name: "Democracy",
    text: `The democratic principle within the European Union is primarily embodied by representative democracy, where citizens participate in the management of public affairs through elected representatives. However, this principle initially had a modest place, leading to criticism of a democratic deficit within the European construction. Democratic legitimacy was mainly based on the accountability of ministers to their national parliaments. Gradually, the European Parliament has strengthened its role to remedy this deficit. First, the designation of its members was done by direct universal suffrage from 1976-1979, increasing its democratic legitimacy. Then, its normative powers and control have significantly increased, especially with the creation of the co-decision procedure after 1992. Finally, the structuring into transnational political groups has promoted the constitution of a real "European public space" according to political scientist J√ºrgen Habermas.
      
Although the European Parliament plays a central role in ensuring the democratic principle, other bodies like national parliaments and specialized institutions, such as the European Ombudsman and the European Economic and Social Committee, also contribute to the control of the Union's acts. Despite this evolution towards representative democracy, elements of direct and participative democracy exist, notably with the right of petition to the European Parliament since 1976 and the European Citizens' Initiative (ECI) established by the Lisbon Treaty. The ECI allows one million European citizens, from at least a quarter of the member states, to push the European Commission to deal with a specific issue.`,

    name: "Equality",
    text: `The principle of equality within the European Union is anchored in the treaties and plays a crucial role in the construction of the Union as a space of social and economic justice. Before the Treaty of Lisbon, non-discrimination was primarily associated with the protection of economic activities in the common market. However, the jurisprudence of the European Court of Justice has expanded legal protection for European citizens in this area.
      
With the Treaty of Lisbon, signed in 2007, the principle of equality became a key objective of the EU, integrating several important treaty standards into the European Charter of Fundamental Rights. The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU, adopted in 2000, is inspired by the constitutional rights of the member states, the European Convention on Human Rights, and universal human rights treaties.
      
The European Court of Justice has always placed great importance on equality, considering it fundamental for establishing a common market and transcending mere instrumental logic. Equality is thus treated as a fundamental human right, with a social and political dimension, and not only as an economic requirement.
      
The principle of equality is closely linked to the principle of non-discrimination, which aims to correct inequalities in treatment.
      
This principle of equality is thus applied extensively by the Court, especially regarding the generality of rules, the primacy of EU law, and the uniform application of law in all member states. It is also expressed through specific EU policies, such as the strategy for equality between men and women, which aim to bridge the gender gaps in all areas of society.`,

    name: "Rule of Law",
    text: `In the context of the European Union, both member states and institutions are primarily bound by the respect for the rule of law, with the obligation that all their acts comply with the treaty, which constitutes the fundamental constitutional charter. This approach engenders a fundamental double consequence: on one hand, these authorities must comply with a set of hierarchically organized legal norms, embodying a hierarchy of sources of European law, where the treaty and derived law play a central role.
      
On the other hand, this compliance with the rule of law requires the presence of effective judicial control, ensured by a judge, to guarantee that the actions of states and institutions respect the principles and provisions of the treaty. This notion of a "community of law" transposed at the European level thus reflects the idea of a rule of law at the scale of the European Union, in opposition to a police state. This concept refers to the need for a solid legal structure and effective judicial oversight to ensure that law prevails in all actions undertaken by state and institutional actors within the Union. The "community of law" is thus a cornerstone of the European project, guaranteeing the primacy of law in the functioning and development of the European Union.`,
