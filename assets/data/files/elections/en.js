    name: "History of the EP Elections",
    text: `The Parliament has not always had elections! When it was created in 1952, under the name of the Common Assembly of the ECSC, its 78 members were actually national deputies who received a double mandate. However, the assembly already had its role as a counter-power to the High Authority, which evolved to become the Commission.\n\nThe Treaties of Rome, which created the EEC and Euratom, gave a special mission to the Common Assembly: it became the common assembly for all communities, while distinct High Authorities were created. In 1962, the Common Assembly renamed itself the European Parliament.\nTo increase democratic legitimacy and the sense of belonging to the European Community, it was decided in 1974 to create real elections for the European Parliament by universal suffrage. This was actually an objective described in the Treaty of Rome but could not be implemented earlier, given the other political priorities of the Council.\n\nThe first elections of the European Parliament were held in June 1979, in the 9 countries of the Community at the time, and in 1981 when Greece joined. At that time, there was no rule for harmonizing the vote: the voting system was different between countries (first-past-the-post in the United Kingdom, mixed proportional in Germany, and proportional in the rest of the countries). Today, all States use the proportional system, which means that a list that obtains 15% of the votes must obtain (approximately) 15% of the seats at stake (different methods of allocating "indivisible" seats exist).\nThe European elections have therefore been held every 5 years since 1979, meaning that 2024 will be the 9th time we vote for the Parliament!\nEach year, the number of deputies evolves, but there are some rules that frame this evolution (in force since the Treaty of Lisbon, in 2009):
      \n
  - There cannot be more than 751 MEPs. This maximum was reached under the previous legislature, was reduced to 705 with the departure of the United Kingdom. In June 2024, there are 720 seats to be elected. Between 2007 and 2009, the Parliament had 785 deputies!
  - The maximum number of MEPs per State is 96. Germany has 96 MEPs, as it is the most populous state in the EU (83.2 million inhabitants)
  - The minimum number of MEPs per State is 6. Cyprus, Luxembourg, and Malta each have 6 MEPs (respectively 1.2 million, 640,000 and 520,000 inhabitants)
  - The seats of the States are allocated in a "degressively proportional" manner between the most populous state (Germany) and the least populous state (Malta). It is a compromise between a representation proportional to the population (where Germany would have 160 times more deputies than Malta) and an equal representation (where Germany would have as many deputies as Malta).
      
  And for 2029?\n\nBeyond the envisaged enlargements, a proposal from 2019 by several heads of state and MEPs has made its way. Since the United Kingdom participated in the European elections in 2019, it was necessary to withdraw the seats in 2020, when it left the EU. The proposal aimed to keep these seats to make a "trans-national" constituency where all Europeans would have voted for the same candidates, regardless of their state of residence. This proposal was not retained for 2024, but why not in 2029?`,

    name: "Voting Days",
    text: `The European elections take place over several days, this year four, from June 6 to 9. But why?\n\nThe vast majority of Europeans (almost 400 million out of the 450 million inhabitants of the EU) vote on Sunday. Indeed, Sunday is chosen in many countries because it is a rest day, allowing the greatest number of people to go to the polling station. This helps to encourage participation in the vote. It is a tradition that exists in many countries outside Europe.\n\nBut other countries have other voting traditions.\n\nIn the Netherlands, as in many countries of Anglophone or liberal monarchy tradition, voting takes place during the week, so that the rest days from Friday to Sunday for religious reasons can be unaffected. In the Netherlands, voting usually takes place on Wednesday, but the European elections are held on Thursday, to have consecutive election days. Denmark also had to change its voting date (traditionally Tuesday), but preferred Sunday.\n\nThe Czech Republic is the only State to vote over two days, Friday and Saturday. This is an electoral law promoted by V√°clav Havel in 1995, which aimed to encourage participation. Although this is criticized by some politicians, especially for the costs it entails, the experiments carried out in the early 2000s over a single day saw a decrease in the participation rate.\n\nIreland is the only State to vote exclusively on Friday. National elections there take place between Thursday and Saturday generally.\n\nOn Saturday, it's Latvia, Slovakia, Malta, as well as the 1.7 million French established in the Americas (inhabitants of overseas regions and communities and expatriates).\n\nAnd finally, on Sunday, it's the turn of Germany, Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Croatia, Denmark, Spain, Estonia, Finland, France, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovenia, Sweden.\n\nEnough to keep you in suspense until the last result!`,

    name: "Constituencies",
    text: `As in many elections (especially those to elect national parliaments), seats in the European Parliament are awarded for a specific geographical area and population, called a constituency.
      \nIn most Member States, there is a single national constituency. This means that all voters elect the same representatives, regardless of the region where they vote. 5 countries are exceptions.
      \nItaly is divided into 5 constituencies: 20 seats for the Northwest (Milan, Turin and Genoa), 15 seats for the Northeast (Bologna, Venice and Padua), 15 seats for the Centre (Rome, Florence and Perugia), 18 seats for the South (Naples, Bari & Catanzaro) and 8 seats for the insular constituency (Sicily and Sardinia)
      \nThe Poland is divided into 13 constituencies that roughly follow the regional administrative division (with some voivodeships merging their constituencies like those of Lesser Poland and Holy Cross). They are allocated between 2 and 7 seats each.
      \nBelgium is divided into 3 constituencies that follow the linguistic division: the French-speaking community (8 seats), the Dutch-speaking community (13 seats), and the German-speaking community (1 seat). Inhabitants of Brussels (part of the first two colleges) vote for the constituency for which they usually vote for the community parliament.
      \nIreland has undergone 2 changes in constituencies, the first in 2004 which changed the division into 4 constituencies, and the second in 2014, which removed the eastern constituency. Today, there are 3 constituencies: Dublin (4 seats), South (5 seats) and Midlands North-West (5 seats).
      \nOther constituencies have existed in the past: those of the United Kingdom before its exit from the EU, but also that of Greenland (Danish territory) during the first election of the Parliament in 1979 (the only MEP of Greenland was Finn Lynge, April 4, 2024 will mark the 10th anniversary of his death). France had a division into 9 regional constituencies between 2004 and 2014, before returning to the single national constituency in 2014`,
