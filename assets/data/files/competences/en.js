This characteristic is reflected in the application of the same customs duty, established at the European level in a common customs tariff, regardless of the point of entry into European territory of an imported good. The customs duties thus collected by the national administrations are then transferred to the budget of the European Union, constituting a significant part of its own resources, representing about 12% of the revenue.
        \nIn connection with this Customs Union, the European Union has a common commercial policy. It has, in principle, exclusive competence to conclude trade agreements with third countries, illustrated by examples such as CETA with Canada. Moreover, this exclusive competence extends to multilateral negotiations, notably within the framework of the World Trade Organization (WTO). This common commercial policy strengthens the coherence and effectiveness of the European Union's external trade relations by allowing a unified approach in the conclusion of agreements and in international negotiations.`,

    text: `European competition law, based on the principle of a free and competitive market economy, includes various prohibitions and regulations. It aims to maintain fair competition and prevent market distortion. Two main prohibitions target private companies: on one hand, the prohibition of cartels, where several companies agree to distort competition, and on the other hand, the prohibition of abuses of dominant position, when companies exercise excessive power over a market. The European Commission, in charge of enforcing these rules, can impose financial penalties, even on non-European companies, when anti-competitive practices affect the European market. This was the case in 2017 when the Commission imposed a fine of 2.42 billion euros on Google.
        \nMoreover, European Union law prohibits state aid that could distort competition. However, exemptions are possible for certain categories of aid, notably those related to social, banking, regional needs, or in case of natural disaster. These rules also apply to services of general economic interest (SGEI), such as energy, transport, and postal services, where specific requirements are imposed to avoid abuses of dominant position.
        \nFinally, competition law has influenced some public services operating in economic sectors, imposing conditions to allow competition and prevent undue advantages linked to a dominant position. However, non-economic public services, relating to sovereign activities, are exempt from these rules, thus preserving their mission of general interest.

The monetary policy aims to achieve growth, full employment, and external balance objectives, with two main goals: stabilize prices and stimulate economic activity.
        \nThe ECB functions more as a monetary policy organ than a fiscal one, focusing its efforts on price stability and maintaining annual inflation above 2%. It engages in dialogue with all European institutions to coordinate its actions.
        \nThe primary objective of the ESCB is price stability, with missions such as implementing a single monetary policy, managing foreign exchange reserves, setting interest rates, monitoring financial markets, and ensuring the security of the system.
        \nMonetary policy relies on two types of policies: conventional and unconventional:
        \nConventional policies rely on traditional tools available to Central Banks. Policy rates, such as the refinancing rate, the deposit facility rate, and the marginal lending rate, influence the activities of commercial banks. Moreover, minimum reserve requirements compel commercial banks to deposit a portion of their funds with the NCBs, thus regulating the availability of credit.
        \nWhen policy rates approach zero, the ECB resorts to unconventional policies, including quantitative easing. This strategy involves buying public debt and other financial assets to inject money into the economy, promoting inflation and recovery. These measures are considered exceptional and temporary.
        \nThese two types of policies aim overall to stabilize prices, as a rise in inflation can devalue the currency, while a drop can lead to deflation. All national banks are required to hold an account at the ECB.`,

Since the creation of the European Social Fund in 1957, promoting employment has become a priority in the spending policy of the European Economic Community, marking the beginning of fiscal policies.
        \nWith entry into the Economic and Monetary Union, countries relinquish the monetary instrument, retaining only the budget to guide their economic policy. National fiscal policies vary based on different determinants such as budget balance, public debt, and economic situation, leading to some heterogeneity among Member States (MS).
        \nThe interdependence of eurozone countries raises the question of fiscal externalities, where fiscal policies in one MS can influence the economic conditions of countries in the zone. Transmission channels of fiscal shocks include trade, competitiveness, monetary policy, and financial aspects, such as sovereign debt.
        \nFiscal policy within the eurozone can be counter-cyclical or pro-cyclical, aiming to reduce or accentuate economic growth fluctuations. Emergency measures taken during the Covid-19 pandemic illustrated national differences in fiscal policies, facilitated by the suspension of the fiscal stability pact.
        \nThe need to establish fiscal rules is justified by financing fiscal policies through state indebtedness. The Stability and Growth Pact establishes criteria such as price stability, currency stability, interest rates, and public finances.
        \nFiscal integration in the eurozone remains a major challenge. The establishment of rules must reconcile the stability objective while allowing some flexibility to the states. Debates focus on establishing a budget for the eurozone and on the need for fiscal federalism to fight against structural asymmetries and stabilize cyclical shocks.`,

Although the initial European treaties did not pay much attention to the marine space, the EU's competences have developed, now allowing it to assert its presence on the international maritime scene.
        \nThe preservation of marine biodiversity is at the heart of the EU's concerns. The European Commission has set the ambitious goal of protecting 30% of the EU's seas by 2030, notably by extending Natura 2000 areas, natural and semi-natural sites of exceptional biodiversity. A legislative project aiming at restoring degraded ecosystems was published in June 2022, with binding objectives for the restoration of specific habitats and species.
        \nFish stock management is also a priority for the EU, as fish and aquaculture products are important components of a healthy diet. The EU is the world's largest seafood market, and overfishing can threaten the reproductive capacity of stocks, affecting food security and the economy.
        \nCombating plastic waste is another major challenge for the health of maritime spaces. The EU is engaged in global initiatives to reduce plastic pollution, including joining a coalition for a binding international treaty on marine debris and plastic pollution. Measures have also been proposed to limit microplastics in products and reduce their release into the environment.
        \nAs part of the "Clean Oceans" initiative, the EU has invested billions of euros in projects aimed at reducing plastic waste globally.

The constant evolution of the market, the result of relentless efforts, benefits both consumers and businesses in the Union. The advent of the digital market represents a major opportunity to stimulate the economy through e-commerce and simplify administrative procedures through e-government.
        \nSince its inception with the Treaty of Rome in 1957, the common market aims to liberalize trade between Member States to increase economic prosperity and promote a closer union among European peoples.
        \nThe Single European Act of 1986 inscribed this objective in the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, defining the internal market as an area without internal borders where the free movement of goods, people, services, and capital is guaranteed. Since its creation in 1993, the single market has gradually opened up to competition, creating jobs and eliminating many trade barriers.
        \nThe Single Market Act, adopted in two phases in 2011 and 2012, reinforced this momentum by proposing several measures to fully exploit the opportunities offered by the single market, boost employment, and increase confidence in businesses. This construction of the internal market is part of a liberal perspective, considering the removal of trade barriers as a driver of growth and job creation.
        \nThe process was marked by several important milestones, including the establishment of the customs union in 1968, the Single European Act of 1986 which set the completion of the internal market for 1993, and the Maastricht Treaty in 1992 which laid the groundwork for adopting the euro as a single currency, thus illustrating the progression towards an integrated and dynamic European economy.`,

It is based on financial interventions, such as co-financing social projects through the European Social Fund, and normative interventions, notably through directives on working time and combating discrimination at work. The key areas of attention in European social policy are employment, training, and fighting poverty, with the goal of reconciling economic efficiency and social progress.
        \nEuropean social policy has often been hampered by the reluctance of Member States to cede control of their social policy, especially with the accession of Ireland and the United Kingdom in 1973. Criticisms also persist due to the perceived near-absence of social Europe, raising questions about its adherence. Despite this, initiatives have been taken, such as the proposal for an intra-EU minimum wage and regulations on collective bargaining. The difficulty lies in the fact that social issues still fall under the sovereignty of the States.
        \nSocial Europe does not aim to reduce national disparities but rather to make them compatible. This concept remains "vague" due to the social policies developed within the framework of the nation-state, which differ from the supranational. Different conceptions during the construction of Europe include projects for harmonizing national systems, social dialogue within European companies, and maintaining national social systems.
        \nA historical return to the construction of social Europe shows a diversity of European social models, ranging from the Bismarckian and Beveridgean models to the Anglo-Saxon liberal, social-democratic, and Christian-democratic models. The slow construction of social Europe has gone through four stages, from the social dimension in the Treaty of Rome to the 2005 break.
        \nDifferent social policies include employment policy, health/social security, gender parity, combating discrimination, and fighting poverty. These policies have evolved over time, with objectives such as improving working conditions, protecting employment, promoting equality, and reducing poverty.

        \nThe differences in unemployment rates, labor costs, and social protection reveal significant gaps between EU Member States. Countries such as Greece, Spain, Ireland, and Portugal experienced a sharp increase in unemployment after the crisis, while Germany recorded a steady decline. Labor costs vary considerably, from Bulgaria to Denmark, reflecting differences in development and economic geography.
        \nThe inherent risks of these disparities include unfair competition, social and fiscal dumping, and the worsening disadvantages for countries lagging in development. Cohesion policy, established since the beginnings of the EU, seeks to address these challenges by promoting the development of lagging regions, reconverting declining regions, combating unemployment, and integrating young people into the workforce.

        \nThe EU's commitment to the environment dates back several decades. The "Birds" Directive of 1979 laid the groundwork for European environmental policy, which was then formalized in the Single European Act of 1986 and expanded with the Maastricht Treaty of 1992. The Amsterdam Treaty of 1997 recognized the principle of sustainable development, while the Lisbon Treaty of 2007 added the objective of promoting international environmental measures.

These objectives include reducing greenhouse gas emissions, adapting to climate change, transitioning to a circular economy, combating pollution, and protecting biodiversity.
        \nTo achieve these objectives, the EU has implemented measures such as the "Fit for 55" package introduced in 2021, aiming to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The EU has also established a carbon emission quota market and a carbon adjustment mechanism at the borders to encourage industries to reduce their emissions.
        \nIn addition to legislating, the EU funds environmental projects through programs such as LIFE and funds like the Just Transition Fund. It also integrates environmental considerations into other areas of action, such as the Common Agricultural Policy and cohesion policy.

        \n- The EU's policy in these strategic areas is guided by several main objectives, designed to maximize the potential of each citizen and strengthen the social fabric of the Union:
        \n- Promoting mobility and lifelong learning: Encouraging student, apprentice, teacher, and young worker exchanges across Europe.
        \n- Enhancing the quality and effectiveness of education and training: Supporting pedagogical innovation and the development of key skills needed in modern society.
        \n- Promoting equity, social cohesion, and active youth engagement: Ensuring everyone has access to education and training, and encouraging youth participation in democratic life.
        \n- Encouraging the development of sports and physical activity: Supporting initiatives that promote health, social inclusion, equal opportunities, and integrity in sports.
        \nTo achieve these objectives, the EU deploys a series of competences and specific instruments:
        \n- Erasmus+ Programme: The flagship EU programme for education, training, youth, and sports, offering opportunities for mobility and transnational cooperation.
        \n- Strategic Framework for European Cooperation in Education and Training (ET 2020/ET 2030): It provides a platform for exchanging best practices, information, and policy advice among Member States.
        \n- EU Youth Strategy: Aims to encourage young people to actively participate in society and improve their access to education, employment, and civic participation.
        \n- EU Work Plan for Sport: Provides a framework for cooperation between Member States and the Commission in the field of sports.
        \nThe EU strives to create a European Education Area by 2025, aiming to strengthen European identity through education and culture and to promote a knowledge- and innovation-based economy. The EU's policy in these areas also aims to support young people in developing essential skills, encourage an active and healthy lifestyle, and strengthen common values of freedom, tolerance, and non-discrimination.
