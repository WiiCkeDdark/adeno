    name: "Flag",
    text: `A widely spread myth â€“ the number of stars on the European flag is not linked to the number of member states of the European Union. Indeed, the twelve stars on the European flag symbolize perfection, unity, and completeness.
  
Featuring a circle of twelve golden stars on a blue background, the European flag is much more than a simple emblem of the European Union: the stars symbolize the European ideals of unity, solidarity, and harmony among its peoples. It was in 1955 (well before the creation of the EU!) that the Council of Europe, seeking to promote human rights and cultivate a common cultural identity, chose a symbol that would embody these ideals. In 1983, the European Parliament made a significant decision by adopting the Council of Europe's flag as its own, thus taking a further step towards a unified European identity. Two years later, in 1985, the leaders of the member states at the time took a decisive step by making the flag the official emblem of the European Communities, the precursors of the current European Union. The scope of the European flag has expanded over time, becoming a globally recognized emblem for the EU and its institutions.
  
For the record, the ECSC originally had a flag with stars whose number varied according to the number of member states (going from 6 to 9, and then 10), like that of the United States! This tradition was stopped with the entry of the eleventh and twelfth members, Spain and Portugal. Whether the establishment of the flag we know today is a coincidence with this moment remains a mysteryâ€¦`,

    name: "Anthem",
    text: `A musical piece that unites the diversity of European cultures and identities - that's the European anthem. Without words, but with a melody everyone knows: Beethoven's "Ode to Joy."
      
Although Beethoven's Ninth Symphony's "Ode to Joy" originally contained lyrics from a poem by Friedrich Schiller, it was decided to play the European anthem in an instrumental version. The universal language of music allows overcoming the linguistic diversity within the European Union. In this spirit, the anthem aims to unify the common values of peace, freedom, and solidarity, and to symbolize the unity of Europe without linguistic barriers. In 1972, the melody was adopted by the Council of Europe, and then in 1985 by the European Union. The European anthem is intended to complement the national anthems of the member states of the European Union and is played at official events involving the European Union.`,

    name: "Common Currency",
    text: `The common currency of the European Union (EU), the euro, introduced in 1999, is one of the most tangible symbols of European integration. It plays a central role in the global economy as the second most used currency after the US dollar. The management of the euro and monetary policy within the eurozone are primarily the responsibility of the European Central Bank (ECB), in collaboration with the national central banks of the eurozone member states, thus constituting the European System of Central Banks (ESCB).
  
The main role of the euro in the EU includes:
- Facilitating trade and investments: By eliminating exchange rate risks and associated costs, the euro facilitates trade and investments between eurozone member states and with the rest of the world.
- Promoting integration and economic stability: The euro contributes to the integration of financial markets and economic stability in Europe, thus promoting sustainable growth.
- Strengthening the EU's political and economic stance: As a major international currency, the euro strengthens the EU's role on the global stage, especially in the fields of international trade and global monetary policy.
  
The monetary policy of the eurozone is defined and implemented by the ECB, which has the primary mandate to maintain price stability and support general economic policies in the EU, aiming to contribute to the achievement of the Union's objectives, including sustainable economic growth and employment. The ECB is independent in the exercise of its functions and in the management of the EU's monetary policy.
  
The euro is the direct descendant of the European Currency Unit (ECU), a unit of account for national central banks between 1979 and 1999. In the Maastricht Treaty, it is even the ECU that is mentioned for the single currency. The transition to the name "euro", aside from administrative reasons related to admissions, is also due to pronunciation issues, such as in German where it sounds like "ein Kuh", meaning a cow!`,

    name: "Day of Celebration",
    text: `Celebration date: May 9.
  
Event celebrated: Robert Schuman's proposal to pacify post-war relations between European countries.
      
Date of establishment: 1985.
      
Linked personalities: Robert Schuman, Jean Monnet.
      
Europe Day, celebrated on May 9 since 1985, commemorates Robert Schuman's proposal in 1950, aimed at pacifying post-war relations between the nations of the Old Continent. Established by European leaders during the European Council of Milan in June 1985, it gathers each year institutions, communities, associations, schools, and citizens around various events. This event highlights the symbols of the unity of the European Union, such as the starred flag, the anthem, and the motto. In the eurozone, the single currency also represents a strong symbol of this unity. Europe Month, throughout May, is marked by numerous events.
      
Robert Schuman's historic declaration on May 9, 1950, propelled by Jean Monnet, called for the pooling under a supranational authority of French and German coal and steel production. Designed to stimulate the post-war economy and guarantee peace between nations, this project is today considered the founding act of European construction. It led to the creation of the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) in 1951.
      
Six years later, the European Economic Community (EEC) emerged, initially focused on an economic union, it gradually expanded to other areas, thus consolidating relations between member states. The European Union, the result of this evolution, embodies Robert Schuman's vision and remains an example of transnational cooperation.`,
