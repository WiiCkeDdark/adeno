    name: "The European Parliament",
    text: `The European Parliament, established in 1979, is the representative body of the citizens of the European Union, ensuring democratic legitimacy and defending their interests. Elected every 5 years by direct universal suffrage since 1979, it allows every European citizen to vote and to stand for election, regardless of nationality. The current President of the European Parliament is Roberta Metsola.
          \nThe composition of the Parliament, capped at 751 MEPs since 2014, has been reduced to 705 following Brexit. MEPs serve a 5-year term with strict incompatibilities, excluding their participation in other European institutions, governments, or national parliaments. Although the official seat is in Strasbourg, most activities take place in Brussels.
          \nThe European Parliament has 7 transnational parliamentary groups, reflecting the main European political families. Since 2019, the two major parties no longer have an absolute majority, marking an evolution in political dynamics. Unlike national parliaments, the European Parliament favors a culture of consensus rather than systematic opposition.
          \nRegarding its responsibilities, the Parliament is involved in two major categories of missions: normative and supervisory.
          \nIn normative matters, the European Parliament plays a legislative role. Although its members do not have the initiative of European laws, which primarily lies with the Commission, MEPs can encourage the Commission to propose legislation. Thus, the Parliament has become a co-legislator with the Council of the EU, participating in co-decision for 95% of European acts. Since the Luxembourg 1 and Brussels treaties, the two institutions have become one of the two branches of the budgetary authority. It adopts the Union's annual budget, with a right of veto over the multiannual budget but is only consulted by the European Council for decisions on own resources, limiting its role in determining the Union's revenue.
          \nThe European Parliament also plays an international role by ratifying treaties concluded by the Union.
          \nIn terms of supervision, the Parliament exercises continuous control over the Commission through various mechanisms, including motions of censure that can lead to the collective resignation of the Commission if approved.`,

    name: "The European Commission",
    text: `The Commission is composed of 27 commissioners, 1 from each member state, who are assigned thematic roles. Its current President is Ursula Von Der Leyen. She is designated by the European Council, taking into account the results of the European elections. She participates, together with the member states, in proposing the commissioners, who are then confirmed by a vote in the Parliament.
      \nThe European Commission is often identified as the "guardian of the treaties," meaning it plays a major role in monitoring and enforcing EU law. It has warning powers to signal risks of infringement to the states and can initiate proceedings in case of non-compliance, notably by bringing cases before the Court of Justice of the European Union. In the field of competition, the Commission can directly impose sanctions on companies violating antitrust rules.
      \nIn addition to its supervisory role, the Commission plays an initiating and proposing function. It issues non-normative recommendations, influencing the coordination of national policies, and holds the legislative initiative for almost all acts of derived Union law. Moreover, it participates in the preparation of the EU budget.
      \nAs the main executive body, the Commission implements Union policies, executes acts adopted by the Parliament and the Council, and ensures the execution of the budget. Although formal executive power lies with the Council of the EU, the Commission acts on its behalf and under its authority, reinforcing its executive role.
      \nOn the international stage, the Commission represents the Union to third countries and international organizations. It negotiates international agreements (which are still subject to ratification by the Council and Parliament), and works in collaboration with the High Representative of the Union, who primarily plays this role since the Treaty of Lisbon.
      \nThe internal functioning of the Commission is marked by the strengthening of the President's role, who holds increasing power in the appointment of commissioners, setting political directions, and organizing the internal structure of the Commission. Operating on the principle of collegiality, each commissioner does not have individual decision-making power, and decisions require a majority vote of the college of commissioners.

    name: "The Council of the EU",
    text: `The Council of the European Union, holder of intergovernmental legitimacy, represents the interests of the member states. Composed of ministerial representatives, it is divided into two major formations since the Treaty of Lisbon: the General Affairs Council, responsible for the internal policies of the Union, and the Foreign Affairs Council, in charge of external policies and presided over by the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy.
      \nThe Council of the European Union operates with a rotating presidency, where a member state holds the presidency for six months. This rotating presidency involves the collaboration of three countries over an 18-month sequence. Currently presided over by Belgium, the next presidency will be assumed by Hungary.
      \nA crucial element in its functioning is the COREPER (Committee of Permanent Representatives), composed of ambassadors, which assists the Council in preparing preliminary negotiations for decisions. It establishes two lists, the "A list" of decisions previously agreed upon between the permanent representatives and the "B list" of sensitive decisions requiring in-depth examination by the ministers before voting, thus playing an essential filtering role.
      \nThe Council's responsibilities highlight the centrality of states in the decision-making process of the European Union. As a legislative branch, it adopts the majority of acts of derived law with the Parliament, playing a crucial role despite the growing competition from the Parliament. As a branch of the budgetary authority, it adopts the Union's budget in collaboration with the Parliament and retains the exclusive decision-making role for questions relating to own resources.
      \nFinally, the Council plays a predominant role in the EU's external relations. It mandates the Commission for international negotiations, notably at the WTO, and ratifies the treaties of the Union, resulting from negotiations with third states or other international organizations. These treaties are then submitted to the Parliament for approval before entering into force.`,
