    name: "The European Parliament",
    text: `The European Parliament, established in 1979, is the representative body of the citizens of the European Union, ensuring democratic legitimacy and defending their interests. Elected every 5 years by direct universal suffrage since 1979, it allows every European citizen to vote and to stand for election, regardless of nationality. The current President of the European Parliament is Roberta Metsola.
          \nThe composition of the Parliament, capped at 751 MEPs since 2014, has been reduced to 705 following Brexit. MEPs serve a 5-year term with strict incompatibilities, excluding their participation in other European institutions, governments, or national parliaments. Although the official seat is in Strasbourg, most activities take place in Brussels.
          \nThe European Parliament has 7 transnational parliamentary groups, reflecting the main European political families. Since 2019, the two major parties no longer have an absolute majority, marking an evolution in political dynamics. Unlike national parliaments, the European Parliament favors a culture of consensus rather than systematic opposition.
          \nRegarding its responsibilities, the Parliament is involved in two major categories of missions: normative and supervisory.
          \nIn normative matters, the European Parliament plays a legislative role. Although its members do not have the initiative of European laws, which primarily lies with the Commission, MEPs can encourage the Commission to propose legislation. Thus, the Parliament has become a co-legislator with the Council of the EU, participating in co-decision for 95% of European acts. Since the Luxembourg 1 and Brussels treaties, the two institutions have become one of the two branches of the budgetary authority. It adopts the Union's annual budget, with a right of veto over the multiannual budget but is only consulted by the European Council for decisions on own resources, limiting its role in determining the Union's revenue.
          \nThe European Parliament also plays an international role by ratifying treaties concluded by the Union.
          \nIn terms of supervision, the Parliament exercises continuous control over the Commission through various mechanisms, including motions of censure that can lead to the collective resignation of the Commission if approved.`,

    name: "The European Commission",
    text: `The Commission is composed of 27 commissioners, 1 from each member state, who are assigned thematic roles. Its current President is Ursula Von Der Leyen. She is designated by the European Council, taking into account the results of the European elections. She participates, together with the member states, in proposing the commissioners, who are then confirmed by a vote in the Parliament.
      \nThe European Commission is often identified as the "guardian of the treaties," meaning it plays a major role in monitoring and enforcing EU law. It has warning powers to signal risks of infringement to the states and can initiate proceedings in case of non-compliance, notably by bringing cases before the Court of Justice of the European Union. In the field of competition, the Commission can directly impose sanctions on companies violating antitrust rules.
      \nIn addition to its supervisory role, the Commission plays an initiating and proposing function. It issues non-normative recommendations, influencing the coordination of national policies, and holds the legislative initiative for almost all acts of derived Union law. Moreover, it participates in the preparation of the EU budget.
      \nAs the main executive body, the Commission implements Union policies, executes acts adopted by the Parliament and the Council, and ensures the execution of the budget. Although formal executive power lies with the Council of the EU, the Commission acts on its behalf and under its authority, reinforcing its executive role.
      \nOn the international stage, the Commission represents the Union to third countries and international organizations. It negotiates international agreements (which are still subject to ratification by the Council and Parliament), and works in collaboration with the High Representative of the Union, who primarily plays this role since the Treaty of Lisbon.
      \nThe internal functioning of the Commission is marked by the strengthening of the President's role, who holds increasing power in the appointment of commissioners, setting political directions, and organizing the internal structure of the Commission. Operating on the principle of collegiality, each commissioner does not have individual decision-making power, and decisions require a majority vote of the college of commissioners.

    name: "The Council of the EU",
    text: `The Council of the European Union, holder of intergovernmental legitimacy, represents the interests of the member states. Composed of ministerial representatives, it is divided into two major formations since the Treaty of Lisbon: the General Affairs Council, responsible for the internal policies of the Union, and the Foreign Affairs Council, in charge of external policies and presided over by the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy.
      \nThe Council of the European Union operates with a rotating presidency, where a member state holds the presidency for six months. This rotating presidency involves the collaboration of three countries over an 18-month sequence. Currently presided over by Belgium, the next presidency will be assumed by Hungary.
      \nA crucial element in its functioning is the COREPER (Committee of Permanent Representatives), composed of ambassadors, which assists the Council in preparing preliminary negotiations for decisions. It establishes two lists, the "A list" of decisions previously agreed upon between the permanent representatives and the "B list" of sensitive decisions requiring in-depth examination by the ministers before voting, thus playing an essential filtering role.
      \nThe Council's responsibilities highlight the centrality of states in the decision-making process of the European Union. As a legislative branch, it adopts the majority of acts of derived law with the Parliament, playing a crucial role despite the growing competition from the Parliament. As a branch of the budgetary authority, it adopts the Union's budget in collaboration with the Parliament and retains the exclusive decision-making role for questions relating to own resources.
      \nFinally, the Council plays a predominant role in the EU's external relations. It mandates the Commission for international negotiations, notably at the WTO, and ratifies the treaties of the Union, resulting from negotiations with third states or other international organizations. These treaties are then submitted to the Parliament for approval before entering into force.`,

    name: "The European Council",
    text: "The European Council, created in 1974, was institutionalized by the Single European Act and the Maastricht Treaty and obtained the status of an institution of the European Union with the Lisbon Treaty. Although it holds decision-making powers on key issues such as treaty revisions, the admission of new members, the withdrawal procedure, Article 7 procedure (procedure to address serious and persistent breaches by a member state of the fundamental values of the European Union) of the Treaty on European Union, and the appointment of the Commission, it does not have a legislative function. Its main role lies in formulating the necessary impulses for the development of the Union and defining general political guidelines. The current President of the European Council is Charles Michel.\n\nThe European Council acts upstream of other institutions, intervening to relaunch the Union's activity in case of deadlock, open cooperation in new areas, make significant budgetary arbitrations, and express common positions on external relations issues, especially in the field of common foreign and security policy (CFSP-CSDP). Its decision-making is generally done by consensus, unless the treaties specify otherwise.\n\nIts fundamentally political role places it above or upstream of the \"institutional triangle\". Since its creation, the European Council has gained influence, reflecting the strengthening of intergovernmentalism and the states' taking back control of European construction. The EU's normative decisions, whether legislative or budgetary, are largely influenced by the political guidelines of the European Council. Despite its structurally subordinate role in the adoption of acts in the Council of the EU, the European Commission, originally an impulse body, has seen its role reduced, often becoming a mere legal relay of the impulses of the European Council. Thus, although the European Council and the European Parliament do not exactly occupy the same political sphere, the Parliament emerges as the main counterweight to the European Council in the Union's institutional system.",

    name: "The Committee of the Regions",
    text: "The European Committee of the Regions (CoR) was established by the Maastricht Treaty (1992) and represents local and regional authorities in the EU. The treaties require its consultation when new legislative acts impact the regional or local level, which concerns 70% of European legislation. The CoR can also be consulted whenever the Parliament, the Commission, or the Council of the EU deems it necessary. The CoR's mission is exclusively advisory, and its opinions are not binding. The Lisbon Treaty (2007) allowed the CoR to file complaints with the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) in case of a breach of the subsidiarity principle or if it considers that the mandatory consultation has not been respected.\n\nConsultation of the Committee of the Regions is mandatory for the following areas: economic, social, and territorial cohesion; structural funds; employment and social affairs; education, youth, vocational training, culture, and sport; environment, energy and climate change; transport; trans-European networks; public health.\n\nThe 329 members of the CoR assembly have a five-year mandate and are appointed by the Council, on the proposal of the member states. France, Germany, and Italy each present 24 delegates, the most, while Malta, with 5 delegates, presents the fewest. To be a member of the Committee, one must necessarily hold an electoral mandate within a regional or local territorial authority, or be politically accountable to an elected assembly.",

    text: "The European Central Bank (ECB) is the central institution of the euro system and was founded in 1998 as part of the European Economic and Monetary Union. It is responsible for monetary policy in the eurozone, with its main objective being to maintain price stability. Its mission - determined by the European treaties - is to ensure price stability through the definition of interest rates to control inflation and preserve the value of the currency. The ECB is also in charge of issuing the single currency, managing euro reserves, and has taken on a banking supervision function since 2014.\n\nThe Eurosystem, composed of the ECB and the central banks of the 20 eurozone member countries, implements the single monetary policy, manages reserves, and conducts foreign exchange operations. Financial and monetary cooperation between the Eurosystem and non-eurozone countries is ensured by the European System of Central Banks (ESCB), which brings together the central banks of all EU member states. It has its own budget and acts independently. Since 2019, Christine Lagarde has been the president of the ECB. Its headquarters are in Frankfurt am Main, Germany.",

Its main mission is to ensure close coordination of the economic policies of the eurozone member states, promoting conditions conducive to stronger economic growth and preparing eurozone summits.\n\nEurogroup meetings, usually held monthly, take place the day before the Economic and Financial Affairs Council (Ecofin), composed of the economy and finance ministers of all member states. The Eurogroup examines issues specifically related to the euro, as well as broader subjects influencing the budgetary, monetary, and structural policies of the eurozone countries.\n\nThe Eurogroup discusses issues such as the macroeconomic situation, structural reforms, financial stability, preparation for international meetings, and the enlargement of the eurozone. It can also discuss decisions of the Council applicable only to eurozone countries.\n\nMeetings include ministers of the eurozone, the president of the Eurogroup, representatives from the Commission, the European Central Bank, and the European Stability Mechanism. The results are presented to the public during press conferences, and the president represents the Eurogroup at the Ecofin Council and during the eurozone summit.\n\nThe president of the Eurogroup is elected for a two-and-a-half-year renewable term by Eurogroup members. Currently, since 13 July 2020, Paschal Donohoe, the finance minister of Ireland, holds this position. His role includes chairing meetings, setting agendas, developing long-term work programs, and representing the Eurogroup internationally.",

    name: "The Court of Justice and the EU Tribunal",
    text: "The judiciary of the European Union is structured around two distinct instances: the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) and the General Court of the European Union. The CJEU, existing since the beginnings of European construction, was previously called the Court of Justice of the European Communities (ECJ) until 2009. The General Court was established in 1986 to relieve the congestion of the ECJ, initially limiting itself to public service cases and sanctions in competition law. However, in 1993, its jurisdiction was extended to all appeals filed by individuals.\n\nCurrently, the Union's judicial system consists of two instances: the CJEU, composed of 27 judges and 11 advocates general, and the General Court, which has two judges per member state, currently totaling 54 judges. These judges and advocates general are appointed for renewable six-year terms, ensuring strict independence and impartiality. Decisions of the General Court may be appealed to the CJEU in case of law violation. The CJEU operates as a court of first instance for institutional appeals and preliminary rulings, and as an appellate court for individual appeals previously handled by the General Court, thus ensuring the uniformity of EU law.\n\nThe mission of the Union's judge can be schematically summarized in four main functions: as an international jurisdiction, it settles inter-state disputes related to treaty application; as a constitutional jurisdiction, it oversees the distribution of competences between the member states and the Union, preserving vertical and horizontal balances; as an administrative jurisdiction, it controls the legality of EU acts and engages the responsibility of institutions; as a regulatory jurisdiction, it ensures the uniform application of EU law.",
