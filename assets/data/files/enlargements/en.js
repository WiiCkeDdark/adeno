    name: "The Founding of the Six",
    text: `The European Union as we know it today is the result of the slow convergence of numerous institutions and international agreements that gradually cemented the political cooperation of European states. Three different institutions founded the European project: the ECSC, the EEC, and Euratom.
    
The construction of Europe is, in its essence, a project of peace. The idea of peace was already expressed in May 1950 with the famous Schuman Declaration, in which the then French Foreign Minister proposed placing the entire Franco-German production of coal and steel under a common High Authority. The objective of the European project was thus defined: the joint management of resources required by the war industry by several states to rule out the possibility of conflict.
      
Two years after the Declaration, the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) was born through the Treaty of Paris, laying the first stone of European integration. The six founding states are France, the Federal Republic of Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg.
      
On their part, the Benelux countries created a model of economic cooperation that greatly interested other countries. Thus, after several preparatory conferences in Messina (Italy), Venice, and Val Duchesse (Belgium), in 1957, the Treaties of Rome were signed, creating the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom) and, more importantly, the European Economic Community (EEC). The EEC aimed to generalize the approach to the entire economy: the goal was the creation of a common market and a customs union between member countries. The EEC and Euratom are the origins of the European Union as we know it today, and soon followed the first enlargements.`,

    name: "The 1st Enlargement",
    text: `On January 1, 1973, the first enlargement of the European Economic Community (EEC) took place with the accession of the United Kingdom, Ireland, and Denmark. With their accession, the number of Member States increased from six to nine. Norway had also filed an application for membership, but the ratification of the accession treaty failed in a referendum in September 1972 (53.5% no, 46.5% yes).
      
The process of accession of the United Kingdom was also difficult at the beginning. Still, in the 1950s, the United Kingdom adopted a skeptical perspective on the process of European integration, focusing on its transatlantic relationship with the United States as well as its relations with its colonies. However, given the economic growth of the European community in the 1960s, British foreign policy evolved towards a more favorable approach to integration.
      
However, on the continental European side, the United Kingdom was met with skepticism - especially in France under the presidency of Charles de Gaulle: on two occasions, the UK's applications for membership were blocked by the French president's veto (1963 and 1967) before the United Kingdom finally joined the EEC in 1973.
      
The first enlargement marks an important turning point in the development of the European community. On the one hand, the economic space of the community was significantly enlarged, but above all, its political orientation also changed. From the beginning of its membership, the United Kingdom has been a major player in the government current, placing great importance on the sovereignty of Member States and focusing on transatlantic relations.`,
